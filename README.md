> "Money is always an issue!" — Jackie.

**Jackie-AI** is an AI Chatbot & Classification platform that combines high-performance machine learning with a premium, "mass" themed user experience. Inspired by the iconic Malayalam cinema character Sagar Alias Jackie, this application allows you to swap between serious professional assistance and the legendary underworld don persona.

## ⚡ Key Features

### 🕺 Jackie Mode (The Mass Update)
Toggle survival mode! Use the **Jackie Mode** switch in the sidebar to flip between:
- **Jackie Mode ON**: Experience the sarcastic, stylized response of Sagar Alias Jackie. No sentiments, only mass. Addressing users as "Customers" and quoting Dubai deals.
- **Jackie Mode OFF**: A professional, concise, and serious AI assistant for quick business logic and accurate data.

### 📄 Underworld PDF Scanner
Equipped with a high-performance PDF parser (`pdf.js`).
- Drop your PDF deals directly into the chat.
- Jackie extracts the hidden text and provides "official quotations" based on the content.
- Support for complex document analysis with context memory.

### 💰 Underworld Sector Classifier
A custom-trained ML model (`scikit-learn` + `TF-IDF`) that identifies deal categories with high confidence.
- Input your "deal details" and the scanner will classify it as **Business**, **Underworld**, or **Gold Deals**.
- Visual confidence meters including 100% Match, Possible, and Low Confidence alerts.

### 🎨 Premium "Mass" UI
- **Design**: Blur-heavy backgrounds with a sleek dark theme.
- **Cartoon Border Styling**: A unique, high-contrast aesthetic that feels alive.
- **Wavy Sine-Wave Animations**: Custom SVG/CSS animations for that "Thinking" state.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for Desktop and Mobile (zooming disabled for consistent PWA-like feel).
